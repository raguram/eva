# Model Building 

I am considering this as an image segmentation problem, where given the fg_bg and the bg image of size H x W x C, I want to predict a mask of size H x W x 1 and depth of H x W x 1. 

## Survey 

[Talk about different papers]
During the survey of existing solutions for image segmentations, I came across https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation. 

## Design 

### Network architecture 

The architecture uses the ResUnet

About the variants of the architecture - Lite mode. 

### Loss functions

This section talks about the analyis of different loss functions. 

#### BCEWithLogits

#### L1 Loss 

#### Dice Loss 

#### SSIM 

#### Root Mean Squared Error Loss 

#### HuberLoss

#### SpatialGradient

#### Berhu Loss

### Metrics

#### IOU

#### Pixel Accuracy 

## Implementation Detail

To start with, I created a tiny dataset out of the bigger set containing randomly picked up 20k fg_bg images with their corresponding mask and depth images. The tiny data set can be accessed at [tiny_data.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tw2Ijf2l7fERsOEQ7k_IMRXYTzm4BaI4).
