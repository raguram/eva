## Problem Statement 

The goal of this assignment is to train a MNIST model having validation accuracy of atleast 99.4% with the following constraints. 

* 99.4% validation accuracy
* Less than 20k Parameters
* Less than 20 Epochs
* No fully connected layer

## Solution 

In this part, I will describe each of the iterations to achieve the above goal. 

#### Iteration 0

I started with the same architecture as provided in our second assignment. The architecture has 6MM parameters. This is to ensure that code I have written works correctly.

In this iteration, I was trying to reduce the number of parameters to be lesser than 20k. Looking at the misclassifications, one of the things I noticed was that there were lesser number of layers in the first filter group (RF was only 5x5). I added one more layer in the first filter group to increase the RF to 7x7 before applying Max pool. I played with different kernel sizes.

Same architecture as above. Added data transformations. Reason: Misclassifications were coming from slight rotation of the digits or missing pixels that differentiats 7 from a 9. So, tried with data transformation. Or may be its just that I got lucky this time :-D
